This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build your own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview).

This challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language.

1. Ensure you have `go (1.22)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run the program, which is implemented in
   `cmd/myinterpreter/main.go`.
3. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
